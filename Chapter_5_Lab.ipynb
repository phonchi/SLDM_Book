Interestingly, these are somewhat different from the estimates obtained using the bootstrap.  Does this indicate a problem with the bootstrap? In fact, it suggests the opposite.  Recall that the standard formulas given in Equation 3.8 on page 66 rely on certain assumptions. For example, they depend on the unknown parameter $\\sigma^2$, the noise variance. We then estimate $\\sigma^2$ using the RSS. Now although the formulas for the standard errors do not rely on the linear model being correct, the estimate for $\\sigma^2$ does.\n","\n","We see in Figure 3.8 on page 91 that there is a non-linear relationship in the data, and so the residuals from a linear fit will be inflated, and so will $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$. Secondly, the standard formulas assume (somewhat unrealistically) that the $x_i$ are fixed, and all the variability comes from the variation in the errors $\\epsilon_i$. The bootstrap approach does not rely on any of these assumptions, and so it is likely giving a more accurate estimate of the standard errors of $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ than is the `summary()` function.\n","\n","Below we compute the bootstrap standard error estimates and the standard linear regression estimates that result from fitting the quadratic model to the data.
